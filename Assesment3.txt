        print(len(list(map(int,x))))
  - 2
15. False statement about recursion:
  - Every recursive funvtion must have a return value
16. The type of each element in sys.argv is 
  - list
17. for function definition we use:
  - def
18. Keyword used for declaring anonymous functions
  - lambda
19. Can we declare loopa and conditionals in anonymous functions:
  - Yes
20. Method used to pass mutiple positional arguments
  - 


SUBJECTIVE:

1.Anonymous function:
     - it is a function without a name.
     - we use lambda keyword for declaring anonymous functions.

2. difference between *args and *kwargs
    - *args:
       - the syntax is to use the symbol * to take in a variable number of arguments.
       -  allows you to do is take in more arguments than the number of formal arguments that you previously defined. With *args, any number of extra arguments can be tacked on to your current formal parameters (including zero extra arguments).
    - **kwargs:
       - The special syntax **kwargs in function definitions in python is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list.
       - We use the name kwargs with the double star. The reason is because the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).
3. Recursion and eample?
    - Recursion is a method of programming or coding a problem, in which a function calls itself one or more times in its body. 
    - If a function definition satisfies the condition of recursion, we call this function a recursive function.
    example:
          def factorial(n):
                   if n == 1:
                       return 1
                   else:
                       return n*factorial(n-1)
4. What are local and global variables
    - Local variables:
      the variables that are declared inside a function and can be used only within that function are called local variables.
    - Global variables:
      the variables that are declared outside the function and can be used anywhere in the code and can be modified anywhere are known as global variables.
5. What are the different ways to import a module?
   -  it can be done in three ways
   - complete import:
       - gets all the components from the module imported.
       - we need to reference it with the module name to use in the python file.
       - import<modulename>

   - specific import:
       - it imports only the required components from the module. the components need not to be referenced.
       - from <modulename> import <components>
   - * import:
       - it imports all the components from the module into the python file, the components need not to be referenced.
       - from <modulename> import *
