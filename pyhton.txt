Loops :

- repititions 
- iterations

there are two kinds of loops
 - finite
 - infinite
every loop requires four important components
  - initialisation
  - limit / condition
 - increment / decrement
 - statements

python has two loops
 - for (for finite iterations )
 - while ( both for finite and infinite)

FOR loop:
 for finite iterations
- it is used with numbers, strings, collections
 - whereas while loop is only for numbers

range() 
 - it is an iterator which can be used only with numbers in a for loop.
 - it can be used in three ways both for incremented and decremented tools

for ----> numbers--->range()

range(<endpoint>) 0 1 2 3 4.......endpoint-1
range(10) 0 1 2 3 4 5......9   initialisation=0, limit=9, step=+1

range(<spoint>,<endpoint>) spoint.spoint+1..................endpoint-1

range(<spoint>,<endpoint>,<step>)
  ---the above all are ictrementing range function.
range(<endpoint>,<spoint>,<step>) ---->decremented range function. ( in decremented it will stop 1 step ahead of spoint value)


syntax of FOR:
 for <dummy> in range():
   <statements>

example:

  for i in range(10)
  print(i)

 for i in range(10)
  print(i ,end="")    --- it will print all the numbers in a single line

 for i in range(3,15,2)
  print(i)
 for i in range(13,7,-1)
 print(i)
 for i in range(100,5,-5)
 print(i)
